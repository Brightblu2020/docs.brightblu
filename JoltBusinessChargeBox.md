Charge Controller:

The charge controller(CC) controls all the hardware systems in the charger. These systems are â€“

1. Control Pilot signal generation and detection of vehicle states.
2. Leakage current detection
3. Input voltage range detection
4. Continuous earth monitoring
5. Temperature monitoring
6. User authentication
7. LED control
8. Charger state monitoring
9. Energy measurements

The charge controller communicates the status messages of the charger hardware to the communication controller.
Find the release notes for the latest version and all previous versions.
If you wish to update the charge controller physically, Please see the Firmware Update Instruction
